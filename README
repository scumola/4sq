This is just some PHP code that I wrote to grab data from the foursquare.com
API using PHP.

cp config_sample.php config.php # and edit accordingly, then
mysqladmin create 4sq
mysql 4sq < db.sql

You'll need to submit one venue before you can do a "search" to populate other
venues near it, but that's about it.

Then you're off and running!
